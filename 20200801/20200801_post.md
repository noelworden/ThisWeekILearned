Git: The Power of the Dash!
Keywords

This is going to be one of those 'short and sweet' posts, but it is going to be oh, so sweet.

Have you ever been bouncing back and forth between branches and wished there was a more efficient way than typing out the branch name each time (even with tab complete)? I present you with:

`git checkout -`

That command will checkout whichever branch you previously had checked out. But, that's not the only git command that accepts the dash, it can also be used with rebase, merge, and cherry-pick.

_- AND -_

After I shared this on my engineering Slack channel, a colleague pointed out that it can be used in file tree navigation:

`cd -`

Talk about a game changer! There's not much else to say, now you can traverse backwards with a few less keystrokes.
