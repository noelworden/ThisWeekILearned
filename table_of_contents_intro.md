Beginning of a Blog Series
learning, thisweekilearned, sql, elixir

I recently started a project using Elixir/Phoenix and raw SQL querying. I have been having a lot of 'aha moments' lately and I feel like they are worth documenting. Personal notes and Github Gists of solutions are nice, but I also figure that if it took me a hot second to find the answer, I'd have to imagine that others may have come up against similar roadblocks. You can never have too much documentation. 

Im shooting for a *This Week I Learned* kind of format, the best 'aha moment' of the week. Ideally, this post would be a sort of table of contents, linking to all the posts, but I'll have to see how that works out. The solutions I write about are as I best understand them. They could be incomplete or need more detail. I welcome all critique and suggestions on how to do things better; I'm always learning.
