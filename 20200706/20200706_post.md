Stepped Away for a Long Weekend

This past week was a short one for me, I took some PTO to take advantage of the holiday weekend. I also decided to take a break from posting, as I really wanted to be able to step away from the computer and decompress. 

I'll keep the series going next week, as I have some great PR's open at the moment and I'm sure I'll get some blog-worthy feedback!
